## ExternalMerge
```
 a class of sorting algorithms that can handle massive amounts of data.    
 External sorting is required when the data being sorted do not fit into the main memory of a computing device (usually RAM)      
 and instead they must reside in the slower external memory,      usually a hard disk drive.         
 Thus, external sorting algorithms are external memory algorithms         
 and thus applicable in the external memory model of computation.

 ## K-means
 ```
 k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization,      originally from signal processing, that is popular for cluster     
 analysis in data mining. k-means clustering aims to partition       
 n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of        
 the cluster. This results in a partitioning of the data space into Voronoi cells.
